Q3/- How many types of relationships exist among tables in the
Database? Explain with some examples, and also mention how to
establish these relationships among tables with examples.


Answer- There is three type of relatioship exist among tables in the database-
		1.One to One
		2.One to Many
		3.Many to Many
		
		
		
1.One to One relationship-
 The example of this is one person having only one driving licence or aadhaar card.
 
 example- 
 create table person
 (
 pid int primary key,
 pname varchar(25),
 address varchar(25)
 );
 
 create table Driving_Licence
 (
 dlid int primary key,
 expiry date,
 pid int,
 foreign key (pid) references Person(pid)
 );
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 
 2.One to Many relationship-
 The example of this is one department having many employees
 
 create table Department
(
did int primary key,
dname varchar(12) not null,
location varchar(12) not null
);

create table Employee
(
empId int primary key,
ename varchar(12) not null,
address varchar(12) not null,
mobile varchar(12) not null,
salary int not null,
deptId int,
Foreign key (deptId) references Department(did)
);


------------------------------------------------------------
 
 3. Many to Many relationship-
 The example of this is relationship between student table and course table, since there are
 many students for one course and many courses for one student so it is many students many courses.
 
 example of many to many relation
 create table Student
(
roll int primary key,
name varchar(12) not null,
address varchar(10) not null,
mobile varchar(10) not null
);

create table Course
(
cid int primary key,
cname varchar(12) not null,
fee int not null,
duration varchar(12) not null
);

//to establish many-to-many we need another table-

create table Student_Course
(
roll int,
cid int,
Foreign key(roll) references Student(roll),
Foreign key(cid) references course(cid)
);
