Q4/ Explain about thread synchronization(inter-thread communication).

Answer-
--It means two synchronized threads communicate with each other.
--for communication some methods are present in Object class-> wait(), notify(), notifyAll() etc.
--By using above methods we can gain partial control on the scheduling mechanism which is 
supervised by the thread-scheduler.

--wait() method-> to suspends a synchronized thread unconditionally.
--notify() method-> to resume a suspended (waiting thread)

--In the inter-thread communicaton the thread which require updatation it has to call
wait() method. The thread which performing updatation it will call notify() method so that
waiting thread will gets the notification and it continueus its execution with those updatation.

--Important- we can call wait(), notify(), notifyAll() methods only in the synchronized methods or
blocks, otherwise we will get a runtime exception.

--To call wait(0 or notify() method on any object we must have that particular object lock
otherwise we will get a runtime exception called IllegalMonitorStateException.

--Once a thread calls wait() method on any object, first it releases the lock immediately
of that particular object and then it enters into the waiting state immediately.

--Once a thread calls notify() method on any object it also releases the lock of that object but not
immediately.
