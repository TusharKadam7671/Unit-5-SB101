Q2/- What’s the difference between class lock and object lock?

Answer-

Class level lock-
1. This lock can be used when we want to prevent multiple threads to enter the 
synchronized block of available instanced on runtime.
2. This lock is used to make static data thread-safe.
3. Multiple objects of a particular class may exist but there is always one 
class’s class object lock available.
4. We can get a class level lock as follows:

public class Lock {

  public void m1( ) {

     synchronized (Lock.class) {

    // some line of code 

  }

}

------------------------------------------------

Object level lock-
1. This lock is used when we want a non-static method or non-static block 
of our code should be accessed by only one thread at a time.
2. This lock is used to make non-static data thread-safe.
3. Every object the class have their own lock.
4. We can get object level lock as follows:

public class Lock {

  public void m1( ) {

     synchronized (this) {

        // some line of code

     }

  }

}
