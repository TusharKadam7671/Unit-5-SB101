Q3/- What is the Serialization and deseiralization in Java

Answer-

--Serialization in Java is a mechanism of writing the state of an object into a byte-stream.

--The reverse operation of serialization is called deserialization where byte-stream is converted 
into an object. 

--The serialization and deserialization process is platform-independent, 
it means you can serialize an object on one platform and deserialize it on a different platform.

--For serializing the object, we call the writeObject() method of ObjectOutputStream class, 
and for deserialization we call the readObject() method of ObjectInputStream class.

--We must have to implement the Serializable interface for serializing the object.
