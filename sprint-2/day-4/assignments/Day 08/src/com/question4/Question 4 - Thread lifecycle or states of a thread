Q4) What are the different states of a thread, or what is thread lifecycle?

Answer- 

--A thread goes through various stages in its lifecycle. For example, a thread is born, 
started, runs, and then dies.

--Following are the stages of the life cycle âˆ’

1. New state- A new thread begins its life cycle in the new state. It remains in this state
until the program starts the thread. It is also referred to as a born thread.
		Thread t = new Thread(r);
 
2. Runnable state- After a newly born thread is started, the thread becomes 
runnable. A thread in this state is considered to be executing its task.
		t.start()

3. Waiting/ Running state- Sometimes, a thread transitions to the waiting state while 
the thread waits for another thread to perform a task. Thread transitions back to the 
runnable state only when another thread signals the waiting thread to continue 
executing.

4. Timed Waiting/ Blocked state- A runnable thread can enter the timed waiting state 
for a specified interval of time. A thread in this state transitions back to the runnable 
state when that time interval expires or when the event it is waiting for occurs.

5. Tetminated/ Dead state- A runnable thread enters the terminated state when it 
completes its task(when run method completes) or otherwise terminates.
