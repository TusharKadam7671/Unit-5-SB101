Q5) Differentiate between the Thread class and Runnable interface for creating a Thread?

Answer- 


Thread class-

1. Thread is a class. It is used to create a thread.
2. It has multiple methods including start() and run().
3. Each thread creates a unique object and gets associated with it.
4. More memory required.
5. Multiple inheritance is not allowed in java hence after a class extends Thread
class, it can not extends any other class.

Runnable interface-

1. Runnable is a *functional interface* which is used to create a thread.
2. It has only abstract method run()
3. Multiple threads share the same objects.
4. Less memory required.
5. If a class is implementing the runnable interface then your class can extends another
class.
