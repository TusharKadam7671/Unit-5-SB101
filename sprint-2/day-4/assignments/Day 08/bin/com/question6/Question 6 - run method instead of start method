Q6) What if we call Java run() method directly instead start() method?

Answer-

--When we call start() method on the thread it causes the thread to begin execution.

--run() method of the thread is called by the Java Virtual Machine.

--If we directly call run method it will be treated as a normal overridden method 
of the thread class (or runnable interface) and it will be executed with in the 
context of the current thread not in a new thread.
