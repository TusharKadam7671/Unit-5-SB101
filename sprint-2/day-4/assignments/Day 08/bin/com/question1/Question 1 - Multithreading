Q1) What do you mean by Multithreading? Why is it important?

Answer- 

--Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more 
parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU. Each part of such program is 
called a thread. So, threads are light-weight processes within a process.

--Threads can be created by using two mechanisms : 
Extending the Thread class 
Implementing the Runnable Interface


--A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. Multiprocessing
and multithreading both are used to achieve multitasking.
--However, we use multithreading than multiprocessing because threads use a shared
memory area so saves memory, and context-switching between the threads takes less
time than process.
--Java multithreading is mostly used in games, animation, etc.
