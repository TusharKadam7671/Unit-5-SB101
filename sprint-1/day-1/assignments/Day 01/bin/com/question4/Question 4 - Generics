Question 4: Explain Generics in Java and Its Importance with example

Answer-

The Java Generics deal with type-safe objects. It makes the code stable by detecting the
bugs at compile time.

Advantages of Generics-
1.Type-safety- we can hold only a single type of objects in generics. It doesn't allow
	to store other objects.

2.Type casting is not required- There is no need to downcast the object.

List list = new ArrayList();
list.add("hello");
String s = (String) list.get(0);	//downcasting is required

List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
list.add("hello");
String s = list.get(0); // no cast

3.Compile-Time Checking- It is checked at compile time so problem will not occur at
	runtime. The good programming strategy says it is far better to handle the problem
	at compile time than runtime.

4.Code reuse âˆ’ You can write a method or, Class or, interface using generic type once 
	and you can use this code multiple times with various parameters.


	
class Student<T>{
   T age;
   
   Student(T age){
   this.age = age;
}
   public void display() {
    System.out.println("Value of age: "+this.age);
   }
}


public class GenericsExample {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
   
      Student<Float> std1 = new Student<Float>(25.5f);
      std1.display();
      
      Student<String> std2 = new Student<String>("25");
      std2.display();
      
      Student<Integer> std3 = new Student<Integer>(25);
      std3.display();
   }
}


*Output-

Value of age: 25.5
Value of age: 25
Value of age: 25
