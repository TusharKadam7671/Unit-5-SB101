Question 2) Explain the difference between Checked and Unchecked exceptions. write some
examples of checked and unchecked exception classes.

Answer-

Checked Exception-

1.These exceptions are checked at compile time. These exceptions are handled at compile time too.
2.These exceptions are direct subclasses of exception but not extended from RuntimeException class.
3.The code gives a compilation error in the case when a method throws a checked exception. 
	The compiler is not able to handle the exception on its own.
4.These exceptions mostly occur when the probability of failure is too high.
5.Common checked exceptions include IOException, DataAccessException, InterruptedException, etc.
6.These exceptions are propagated using the throws keyword.
7.It is required to provide the try-catch and try-finally block to handle the checked exception.

Example-

private static void checkedExceptionWithTryCatch() {

    File file = new File("not_existing_file.txt");
    
    try {
    
        FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream(file);
        
    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}


Unchecked Exception-

1.These exceptions are just opposite to the checked exceptions. These exceptions are 
	not checked and handled at compile time.
2.They are the direct subclasses of the RuntimeException class.
3.The code compiles without any error because the exceptions escape the notice of the compiler. 
	These exceptions are the results of user-created errors in programming logic.
4.These exceptions occur mostly due to programming mistakes.
5.Common unchecked exceptions include ArithmeticException, InvalidClassException, NullPointerException, etc.
6.These are automatically propagated.
7.In the case of unchecked exception it is not mandatory.


Example-

class UncheckedException {    

   public static void main(String args[])  
   {  
   
    int postive = 35;  
    int zero = 0;  
    int result = positive/zero;  
    //Give Unchecked Exception here.
       
	System.out.println(result);  
	
   }  
} 

class UncheckedException {  
  
   public static void main(String args[])  
   {  
   
    int num[] ={10,20,30,40,50,60};  
    System.out.println(num[7]);  
    
   }  
}
